# üîí SecureChat

A browser-based, end-to-end encrypted chat application built with **React.js**, **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, and **OpenPGP.js**. SecureChat ensures that only you and your chat partner can read your messages‚Äî**not even the server can decrypt them**.

---

## üöÄ Features

- **End-to-End Encryption:** All messages are encrypted in the browser using OpenPGP.js. Only sender and recipient can decrypt.
- **Hybrid Encryption:** Each message is encrypted with a random AES key, which is then encrypted with both the sender's and recipient's public keys.
- **Secure Key Management:**  
  - RSA key pairs are generated in the browser.
  - The private key is encrypted with your password and stored securely in the database.
  - The decrypted private key is kept only in memory for your session.
- **User Authentication:** JWT-based login and registration.
- **Real-Time Messaging:** Instant message delivery using Socket.io.
- **Modern Responsive UI:** Clean, mobile-friendly interface.
- **Online Status:** See who is online in your contact list.
- **Session Security:** Password is required only once per session to unlock your private key.

## ‚ö° Getting Started

### 1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/securechat.git
cd securechat
```

### 2. **Setup Environment Variables**

```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
# Edit backend/.env and set your MongoDB URI and JWT secret
```

### 3. **Install Dependencies**

```bash
npm run install-all
```

### 4. **Start the App**

```bash
npm run dev
```
- The backend runs on `http://localhost:5000`
- The frontend runs on `http://localhost:3000`

## üë§ User Flow

### **Registration**
- Enter a username and password.
- The browser generates an RSA key pair.
- The private key is encrypted with your password (AES) and sent to the server.
- The public key and encrypted private key are stored in the database.

### **Login**
- Enter your username and password.
- The encrypted private key is fetched from the server.
- The browser decrypts the private key using your password (never sent to the server).
- The decrypted private key is kept only in memory for the session.

### **Sending Messages**
- Select a contact from the sidebar.
- Type your message and send.
- The message is encrypted with a random AES key.
- The AES key is encrypted with both your and the recipient's public keys.
- The encrypted message and key are sent to the server and delivered in real-time.

### **Receiving Messages**
- The browser uses your private key to decrypt the AES key.
- The AES key is used to decrypt the message.
- Only you and the recipient can read the message.

---

## üîê Security Highlights

- **Zero-Knowledge:** The server never sees your password or decrypted private key.
- **Forward Secrecy:** Each message uses a new random AES key.
- **Hybrid Encryption:** Combines speed (AES) and security (RSA).
- **No Plaintext Storage:** All sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit.
- **Session Security:** Decrypted private key is never stored in localStorage‚Äîonly in memory.

## üìù How It Works (Technical Overview)

1. **Key Generation:**  
   - On registration, the browser generates an RSA key pair.
   - The private key is encrypted with your password using AES and sent to the server.

2. **Message Encryption:**  
   - Each message is encrypted with a random AES key.
   - The AES key is encrypted with both the sender's and recipient's public keys.
   - The encrypted message and AES key are sent to the server.

3. **Message Decryption:**  
   - The recipient (or sender) uses their private key to decrypt the AES key.
   - The AES key is used to decrypt the message.

4. **Real-Time Delivery:**  
   - Messages are delivered instantly using Socket.io.

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Can the server read my messages?**  
A: No. All messages are end-to-end encrypted. Only you and your chat partner can decrypt them.

**Q: Where is my private key stored?**  
A: Your private key is encrypted with your password and stored in the database. The decrypted key is only ever in your browser‚Äôs memory for your session.

**Q: What if I forget my password?**  
A: You will not be able to decrypt your private key or your messages. There is no password reset for security reasons.

**Q: Can I use this on multiple devices?**  
A: Yes, but you must log in and enter your password on each device to decrypt your private key.
